            <h3>THE ULTIMATE PRESENCE.</h3>
            <p>
                The BMW i8 Roadster reveals itself as futuristic right down to the last detail. Its progressive lines
                speak
                a
                formal language that can hardly be more dynamic. The most striking feature: the imposing lightweight
                carbon-fibre hinged doors, which can be opened comfortably. The athletic front continues to display the
                individual character of the car and proudly bears the BMW double kidney, flanked by full-LED headlights
                and
                redesigned Air Curtains. Starting at the

                bonnet, the distinctive V-shaped black belt stretches along the entire car, underscoring its flat
                silhouette.
                The impressive streamflow design also optimises airflow and creates unprecedented aerodynamics. Thus,
                the
                BMW i8
                Roadster is a perfect symbiosis of form and function that knows only one destination: ultimate freedom.

                The interior of the BMW i8 Roadster also underscores its unique character. This is immediately apparent
                from
                the
                exclusive feature line Accaro Amido/E-Copper. The interior also reflects the dynamic lines of the
                exterior
                design, creating a futuristic dynamic throughout the cockpit. The centre cockpit is inclined to the
                driver
                and
                the controls are arranged intuitively – ensuring maximum driver orientation and clarity. Optimum lateral
                support
                and maximum comfort are provided by the new electrically-adjustable sport seats with memory function.
                Behind
                the
                seats is additional storage space. With the optional Travel Packet, retractable dividers and an extra
                Nappa
                Leather map pocket are available. In the dark, the LED interior lighting ensures a high-quality
                ambience.
                The
                contour lines of the doors, the instrument panel, the centre console and the steering wheel can be
                optionally
                and alternately dipped in the colours EfficientDynamics Blue, Amber Yellow and White.

                <p> Perfectly topping up the brilliant appearance: the 20” light-alloy wheels 516 in Jet Black matt. Its
                    characteristic rim design not only refers directly to a genuine BMW i, but also fits perfectly with
                    the
                    iconic
                    appearance of the BMW i8 Roadster.
