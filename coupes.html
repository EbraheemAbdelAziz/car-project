        <div class="paragraph">
            The Mercedes-AMG GT combines the fascinating qualities of an authentic sports car with technology leadership
            in

            accelerating
            from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.0 seconds, the Mercedes-AMG GT is the perfect match for those who enjoy a sporty
            lifestyle. It expresses the very essence of the AMG performance brand.

                <h3> Panoramic sunroof</h3>
                <p>
                    With the panoramic roof you can create a particularly bright, friendly atmosphere in the interior.
                    The
                    glass
                    module stretches across the entire roof area, thus creating the impression of a continuous glass
                    area
                    from
                    where
                    the windscreen begins to where the rear window ends. You are protected from strong sunlight by a
                    manual
                    roller
                    sun blind.

                <h3>AMG matt carbon-fibre trim elements</h3>
                <p>
                    The trim lends your interior an individual look. It blends in harmoniously while also creating
                    exciting
                    contrasts. As such it reinforces and underscores the interior design. At the same time, the trim is
                    a
                    continually discernible sign of the quality of a meticulously finished premium product.

        The cockpit boasts a high-tech setting: a user interface concept featuring fully <br>
        digital instruments and a 31.2cm (10.2-inch) display. Centre-stage is <br>
        the new centre console with innovative display switches. The AMG Performance <br>
        steering wheel in nappa leather with AMG steering wheel buttons ensures a firm grip on proceedings. <br>
        Materials worked to exquisite standards of craftsmanship <br>
        bestow a hand-made quality on the vehicle interior.
