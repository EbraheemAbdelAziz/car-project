            <h2>Even more output, even more power: The epitome of performance</h2>
            <p>Positioned between the axles, the 5.2 FSI engine is at the heart of the Audi R8. It boosts the character
                of
                the vehicle with its unrestrained power – a maximum of 560 Nm of torque is available at 6200 revolutions
                per
                minute, proving a close relationship with high-tech racing cars. The special ignition sequence for the
                10
                cylinders ultimately leads to an utterly characteristic sound: a throaty hissing and roaring noise.

            <p> The combination of MMI navigation plus and Audi virtual cockpit that comes as standard is
                designed to make all functions easy to operate, without you having to take your hands off the wheel or
                your
                eyes off the road. On the 12.3-inch display of the Audi virtual cockpit, the focus is on a rev counter
                around which other performance values can be arranged, such as torque, G-forces, lap times, engine and
                gear
                oil temperatures plus tyre pressure and temperature. There is also an additional button available for
                the
                Audi R8 Coupé V10 performance that enables you to directly control specially configured performance
                programmes.

                <h3>Interior: Focus and elegance</h3>
                Its proximity to racing is also noticeable in the interior of the Audi R8: directly in front of you, a
                large, contoured arc visually encompasses all the controls. Heated sports seats are electrically and
                pneumatically adjustable and upholstered in high-quality Nappa leather. For the Audi R8 Coupé V10
                quattro,
                new colour combinations are available with no limit to individual requests.
