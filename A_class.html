            bodystyling with special front and rear aprons lends the car a resemblance to AMG models. The engineering
            with a
            lowered, sportily tuned suspension and the Direct-Steer system intensify the driving experience.

            The interior of the BMW i8 Roadster also underscores its unique character. This is immediately apparent from
            the
            exclusive feature line Accaro Amido/E-Copper. The interior also reflects the dynamic lines of the exterior
            design, creating a futuristic dynamic throughout the cockpit. The centre cockpit is inclined to the driver
            and
            the controls are arranged intuitively â€“ ensuring maximum driver orientation and clarity. Optimum lateral
            support
            and maximum comfort are provided by the new electrically-adjustable sport seats with memory function. Behind
            the
            seats is additional storage space. With the optional Travel Packet, retractable dividers and an extra Nappa
            Leather map pocket are available. In the dark, the LED interior lighting ensures a high-quality ambience.
            The
            contour lines of the doors, the instrument panel, the centre console and the steering wheel can be
            optionally
            and alternately dipped in the colours EfficientDynamics Blue, Amber Yellow and White.
